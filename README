"Mixin" layer for adding latest nodejs-18.x into the Yocto Project LTS.

At the time Kirkstone was released in May 2022, nodejs v16 was the latest
version and officially it's the only nodejs version supported by Kirkstone.
Kirkstone will be supported until April 2026 but nodejs-16 is EOL as of October
2023, making it unsuitable for projects during the lifetimg of Kirkstone.

This mixin layer is meant to address this issue by backporting nodejs-18 and
nodejs-20 versions from the mickledore and master branches of meta-openembedded,
respectively.

The actual versions of nodejs that are available can be found by inspecting the
contents of recipes-devtools/nodejs.

Including the layer automatically picks up the latest nodejs version; different
versions must be set explicitly by adding the following line to your distro
config or local.conf:

NODE_VERSION = "20%"
