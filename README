"Mixin" layer for adding latest Go toolchain versions into the Yocto Project LTS.

At the time Dunfell was released in April 2020, Go 1.14 was the latest version
and officially Dunfell supports only that. This thin special-purpose mixin
layer is meant to address this issue by backporting Go recipes from the master
branch of openembedded-core.

You can see what Go versions are provided by listing recipes-devtools/ content.

Including the layer automatically picks up the latest Go version; different versions
need to be set explicitly by adding the following line to your distro config 
or local.conf:

GOVERSION = "1.16%"

Please note: enabling these newer Go versions makes docker from dunfell branch
of meta-virtualization unbuildable as it is too old. If you need a working docker
recipe, you can use the supplementary 'dunfell/docker' layer from this meta-lts-mixin
repository.
